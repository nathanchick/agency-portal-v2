## Getting Started

Your dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in. It can display various widgets showing important information like recent tickets, timesheet summaries, project status, and more.

The dashboard is fully customizable - you can add, remove, reorder, and configure widgets to match your workflow and preferences.

### Entering Edit Mode

To customize your dashboard:

1. Navigate to your dashboard (the home page after login)
2. Click the **"Customize Dashboard"** button in the top-right corner
3. Your dashboard will enter edit mode, showing additional controls for each widget

When in edit mode, you'll see:
- Drag handles on each widget for reordering
- Settings icons to configure individual widgets
- Remove buttons to delete widgets
- An "Add Widget" button to add new widgets
- Save and Cancel buttons to apply or discard your changes

## Adding Widgets

You can add new widgets to your dashboard to display additional information.

### Steps to Add a Widget

3. A dialog will appear showing all available widgets
4. Browse the available widgets or use the search box to find a specific one
5. Click on the widget you want to add
6. The widget will be added to your dashboard immediately
7. Click **"Save"** to keep your changes

### Available Widgets

The widgets available to you depend on:
- **Your role** (Admin, Manager, or User)
- **Your account type** (Organisation or Customer user)
- **Enabled modules** in your organisation

For example:
- Only Admin and Manager roles may see billing widgets

### Widget Categories

Widgets are typically organized by module:
- **Tickets**: Recent tickets, ticket statistics, support metrics

## Configuring Widget Settings

Many widgets have customizable settings to control what data they display and how.

### Steps to Configure a Widget

1. Click **"Customize Dashboard"** to enter edit mode
2. Find the widget you want to configure
3. Click the **Settings** icon (⚙️) in the widget's top-right corner
4. A settings dialog will appear
5. Adjust the settings as needed (see below for common settings)
6. Click **"Save"** to apply your changes
7. The widget will update to reflect your new settings
8. Click **"Save"** on the main dashboard to keep your changes

### Common Widget Settings

Different widgets have different settings, but here are some common ones:

#### Data Limits
- **Number of items**: Control how many items to display (e.g., 10 tickets vs. 50)
- **Page size**: Items per page for paginated widgets

#### Filters
- **Status filter**: Show only items with specific statuses (e.g., "Open" tickets only)
- **Priority filter**: Filter by priority level (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Category filter**: Show only specific categories or types

#### Date Ranges
- **Date range**: Control the time period (today, last 7 days, last 30 days, custom range)
- **Group by**: Group data by day, week, or month

#### Display Options
- **View type**: Choose between list view, grid view, or chart
- **Sort order**: Sort by date, priority, status, etc.
- **Show/hide columns**: Toggle which columns appear in tables

#### Refresh Settings
- **Auto-refresh**: Enable automatic data updates
- **Refresh interval**: How often to update (30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes)

### Example: Configuring the Recent Tickets Widget

1. Open the widget settings
2. Set **Number of tickets** to 15 (shows 15 tickets instead of the default 10)
3. Set **Status filter** to "Open" (only shows open tickets)
4. Set **Priority filter** to "High" and "Critical" (only shows high-priority items)
5. Click **Save**

Your widget will now show only the 15 most recent open tickets with high or critical priority.

## Tips for Effective Dashboard Layout

Here are some best practices for organizing your dashboard:

### Organization Strategies

1. **Prioritize Important Information**
   - Place your most-used widgets at the top
   - Use larger widget sizes (2-3 columns wide) for critical data
   - Keep less important widgets toward the bottom

2. **Group Related Widgets**
   - Place related widgets near each other (e.g., all ticket widgets together)
   - Use a logical flow (e.g., overview at top, details below)

3. **Balance Information Density**
   - Don't overcrowd your dashboard - remove widgets you don't use
   - Use a mix of summary widgets and detail widgets
   - Leave some breathing room between sections

4. **Consider Your Workflow**
   - Arrange widgets in the order you check them each day
   - Place action-required widgets prominently
   - Use quick link widgets for frequently accessed pages

5. **Optimize for Your Screen**
   - On large monitors: Use 3-column layouts with larger widgets
   - On laptops: Stick to 2-3 column layouts
   - On tablets: Use wider widgets (2-3 columns) that stack vertically

### Widget Selection Tips

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with 3-5 essential widgets
   - Add more as you identify needs
   - Remove widgets that you don't check regularly

2. **Use Filters Wisely**
   - Configure filters to show only actionable items
   - Avoid duplicating information across widgets
   - Use date ranges that match your review cycle

3. **Leverage Role-Specific Widgets**
   - Admins: Add overview and analytics widgets
   - Managers: Add team summary and status widgets
   - Users: Add personal work and task widgets

### Mobile Considerations

If you frequently access the dashboard on mobile devices:
- Widgets automatically stack into a single column on small screens
- Place your most important widgets at the top (they'll appear first)
- Avoid adding too many widgets (scrolling is harder on mobile)
- Test your layout on mobile after customizing

### Accessibility

For better accessibility:
- Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between widgets (Tab key)
- Drag and drop works with keyboard arrow keys
- Screen readers will announce widget names and content
- High contrast mode is supported for all widgets

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Can I have different dashboard layouts for different organisations/customers?**

A: Yes! Your dashboard layout is saved separately for each organisation or customer context. When you switch between organisations, your custom layout for that organisation will load automatically.

**Q: Will my dashboard layout sync across devices?**

A: Yes. Your dashboard preferences are saved to your account, not your device. You'll see the same layout on any device you log in from.

**Q: Can I share my dashboard layout with other users?**

A: Currently, dashboard layouts are personal and cannot be shared. Each user must customize their own dashboard. (This may be added in a future update.)

**Q: What happens if a module is disabled?**

A: If a module is disabled by your organisation administrator, widgets from that module will automatically be hidden from your dashboard. They'll reappear if the module is re-enabled.

### Widget Management

**Q: Why can't I see certain widgets?**

A: Widget availability depends on your role, account type, and enabled modules. For example:
- Customer users don't see organisation-wide widgets
- Users without Manager/Admin roles may not see administrative widgets
- Widgets from disabled modules won't appear

**Q: Can I add the same widget multiple times?**

A: No, each widget can only be added once to your dashboard. However, some widgets may have different versions (e.g., "My Tickets" vs. "All Tickets").

**Q: How many widgets can I add?**

A: There's no hard limit, but we recommend 6-12 widgets for optimal performance and usability. Too many widgets can slow down your dashboard and make it harder to find information.

**Q: Do widgets update in real-time?**

A: Most widgets refresh their data periodically (every 30 seconds to 5 minutes) or when you manually refresh the page. Some widgets have configurable auto-refresh settings.

### Customization

**Q: Can I resize widgets?**

A: Widget sizes are determined by their width setting (1-3 columns). In edit mode, you can usually adjust this in the widget settings. Some widgets have fixed sizes.

**Q: Can I change widget colors or themes?**

A: Widget styling follows your account's theme settings. Individual widget color customization is not currently available.

**Q: Will my changes be saved automatically?**

A: No, you must click the **"Save"** button to save your changes. If you navigate away or click **"Cancel"**, your changes will be discarded.

**Q: Can I undo changes after saving?**

A: There's no undo feature, but you can always re-customize your dashboard or reset to defaults.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: My dashboard is loading slowly. What can I do?**

A: Try these steps:
1. Remove widgets you don't use
2. Reduce the number of items displayed in widget settings (e.g., show 10 tickets instead of 50)
3. Disable auto-refresh for widgets you don't need to update frequently
4. Clear your browser cache and refresh

**Q: A widget is showing an error. What should I do?**

A:
1. Try refreshing the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. Check if the module is enabled
3. Remove and re-add the widget
4. Contact support if the error persists

**Q: I accidentally removed a widget. How do I get it back?**

A:
1. Enter edit mode
2. Click "Add Widget"
3. Find and add the widget again
4. Reconfigure its settings if needed
5. Save your changes

**Q: The drag-and-drop isn't working. What's wrong?**

A:
1. Make sure you're in edit mode (click "Customize Dashboard")
2. Try refreshing your browser
3. Check if you're clicking the drag handle (⋮⋮ icon), not the widget content
4. On mobile, use a tap-and-hold gesture
5. Try using a different browser if the issue persists

### Data and Privacy

**Q: Can my manager see my dashboard layout?**

A: No, your dashboard layout is private. However, the data shown in widgets respects your permission level - you'll only see data you have access to.

**Q: If I'm removed from a team, will those widgets disappear?**

A: Yes, if you lose access to certain data (e.g., removed from a customer team), widgets showing that data will either become empty or be automatically hidden.

**Q: Are my widget settings backed up?**

A: Your widget settings are stored in the database and included in regular system backups. However, we recommend taking note of important configurations.
