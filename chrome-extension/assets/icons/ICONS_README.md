# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- icon16.png (16x16px)
- icon48.png (48x48px)
- icon128.png (128x128px)

For now, placeholder icons are used. Replace these with your branding:

1. Create icons in the portal's brand colors
2. Use a clock or timer motif to represent time tracking
3. Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at all sizes
4. Export as PNG with transparency

## Recommended Tools
- Figma (for design)
- GIMP or Photoshop (for export)
- Online favicon generators

## Icon Guidelines
- Keep design simple and clear
- Use portal brand colors
- Ensure good contrast
- Test visibility on light and dark backgrounds
